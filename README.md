# Next.js Standalone ECS Site

This is a standalone ECS site that uses Next.js and is deployed to AWS ECS.

It employs AWS EFS to share the `.next` directory between containers to facilitate proper Incremental Static Regeneration.

A Usage Guide will be available soon, but some minimal scripts will need to accompany any repo that uses this template. They are available in the `docker` folder.
